/*operators are the tool which can do some sort of operation

Different type of operator
Additional (+)
Subtraction (-)
Divison (/)
Multipication (*)
reminder (%)
Exponential (**)

*/

/* Operand are the value on whose operation was done */

let a = 2; 
let b = 3;
// here a and b are opernad because we Performing operation on them

console.log(a+b) //addition
console.log(a-b) // subtraction
console.log(a/b) //division
console.log(a*b) //multipication
console.log(a%b) //reminder
console.log(a**b) //exponential


/*In JavaScript, the "assigned operator" is likely referring to the assignment operator (`=`). This operator is used to assign a value to a variable or a property.

For example:
```javascript
let x = 5; // Here, '=' is the assignment operator, assigning the value 5 to the variable x.
```

JavaScript also has compound assignment operators, which combine assignment with another operation, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. These include:

- `+=` (addition assignment)
- `-=` (subtraction assignment)
- `*=` (multiplication assignment)
- `/=` (division assignment)
- `%=` (remainder assignment)
- `**=` (exponentiation assignment)

For instance:
```javascript
let y = 10;
y += 3; // equivalent to y = y + 3;
console.log(y); // Output will be 13
```

These operators perform the specified arithmetic operation and then assign the result back to the variable on the left-hand side.

Understanding how assignment operators work is fundamental for manipulating variables and values in JavaScript.*/
